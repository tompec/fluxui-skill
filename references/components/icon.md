# Icon

Flux uses the excellent Heroicons project for its icon collection. Heroicons is a set of beautiful and functional icons crafted by the fine folks at [Tailwind Labs](https://tailwindcss.com)

Search for the exact icon you need over at [Heroicons](https://heroicons.com/)

```blade
<flux:icon.bolt />
```

## Variants
There are four variants for each icon: outline (default), solid, mini, and micro.

```blade
<flux:icon.bolt />
<!-- 24px, outline --><flux:icon.bolt variant="solid" />
<!-- 24px, filled --><flux:icon.bolt variant="mini" />
<!-- 20px, filled --><flux:icon.bolt variant="micro" />
<!-- 16px, filled -->
```

## Sizes
Control the size (height/width) of an icon using the size-\* Tailwind utility.

Avoid tweaking icon sizes. Each variant is specifically designed for its default size.

```blade
<flux:icon.bolt class="size-12" />
<flux:icon.bolt class="size-10" /><flux:icon.bolt class="size-8" />
```

## Color
You can customize the color of an icon using Tailwind's [text color utilities](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/text-color)

```blade
<flux:icon.bolt variant="solid" class="text-amber-500 dark:text-amber-300" />
```

## Loading spinner
Flux has a special loading spinner icon that isn't part of the Heroicons collection. You can use this special icon anywhere you would normally use a standard icon.

```blade
<flux:icon.loading />
```

## Dynamic icons
If you need to dynamically set an icon, you can use the flux:icon component and pass in the icon name as a prop.

```blade
<flux:icon name="bolt" />
```

## Lucide icons
We love Heroicons, but we acknowledge that it's a fairly limited icon set. If you need more icons, we recommend using [Lucide](https://lucide.dev/) instead.

To make it trivial to use Lucide icons, Flux provides a convenient artisan command to import them into your project:

```
php artisan flux:icon
```

This command will prompt you to select which icons you want to import. You can also manually specify the icons you want to import by passing in their names as arguments to the command:

```
php artisan flux:icon crown grip-vertical github
blade
<flux:icon.crown />
<flux:icon.grip-vertical /><flux:icon.github />
```

## Custom icons
For full control over your icons, you can create your own Blade files in the resources/views/flux/icon directory in your project.

```
- resources    - views        - flux            - icon                - wink.blade.php
```

You can simply paste SVG code directly into the Blade file, however we recommend using the following template structure to ensure compatibility with other components:

```
@php $attributes = $unescapedForwardedAttributes ?? $attributes; @endphp@props([    'variant' => 'outline',])@php$classes = Flux::classes('shrink-0')    ->add(match($variant) {        'outline' => '[:where(&)]:size-6',        'solid' => '[:where(&)]:size-6',        'mini' => '[:where(&)]:size-5',        'micro' => '[:where(&)]:size-4',    });@endphp{{-- Your SVG code here: --}}<svg {{ $attributes->class($classes) }} data-flux-icon aria-hidden="true" ... >    ...</svg>
blade
<flux:icon.wink />
```
