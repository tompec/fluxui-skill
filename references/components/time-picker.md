# Time picker

Allow users to select specific times for scheduling events or setting appointments. Perfect for time-based filtering and precise scheduling.

```blade
<flux:time-picker />
```

## Basic usage

Set the initial selected time using the value prop with a H:i formatted time string:

```blade
<flux:time-picker value="11:30" />
```

You can also bind the selection to a Livewire property using wire:model:

```blade
<flux:time-picker wire:model="time" />
```

## Input trigger
Attach the time picker to a time input for more precise time selection control.

```blade
<flux:time-picker type="input" />
```

## Without dropdown

Remove the dropdown from the input trigger.

```blade
<flux:time-picker type="input" :dropdown="false" />
```

## Multiple times
Allow users to select multiple times.

```blade
<flux:time-picker multiple />
```

## Time format
By default, the time picker will use the browser's locale to determine the time format.

You can override this by setting the time-format attribute to 12-hour or 24-hour.

```blade
<flux:time-picker time-format="12-hour" />
<flux:time-picker time-format="24-hour" />
```

## Interval
You can set the interval between the displayed time options by setting the interval attribute to a number of minutes. The default is 30 minutes.

```blade
<flux:time-picker interval="60" />
```

## Min/max times
Restrict the selectable times by setting minimum and maximum boundaries.

```blade
<flux:time-picker min="09:00" max="17:00" />
```

You can also use the convenient "now" shorthand:

```blade
<!-- Prevent selection before now... -->
<flux:time-picker min="now" />

<!-- Prevent selection after now... -->
<flux:time-picker max="now" />
```

## Unavailable times
Disable specific times from being selected. Useful for blocking out appointments, showing booked times, or indicating unavailable time slots.

```blade
<flux:time-picker unavailable="03:00,04:00,05:30-07:29" />
```

## Open to
Set the time that the time picker will open to. Otherwise, the time picker defaults to the selected time, or the current time.

```blade
<flux:time-picker open-to="10:00" />
```

## Localization
By default, the time picker will use the browser's locale (e.g. navigator.language).

You can override this behavior by setting the locale attribute to any valid locale string (e.g. fr for French, en-US for English, etc.):

```blade
<flux:time-picker locale="ja-JP" />
```
