# Installation

Flux is a robust, hand-crafted, UI component library for your Livewire applications. It's built using [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) and provides a set of components that are easy to use and customize.

Starting a new project? Flux comes baked into the new [Livewire starter kit \->](https://laravel.com/docs/12.x/starter-kits#livewire)

## Prerequisites

Flux requires the following before installing:

[

Laravel

Version 10 or later

](https://laravel.com/docs/11.x/installation)[

Livewire

Version 3.7.0 or later

](https://livewire.laravel.com/docs/installation)[

Tailwind CSS

Version 4.1 or later

](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/installation)

## Getting started

Flux can be installed via composer from your project root:

```
composer require livewire/flux
```

If you have purchased a Flux Pro license, you can install it using the following command:

```
php artisan flux:activate
```

During the activation process, you will be prompted to enter an email and license key.

*If you haven't purchased a Flux Pro license, [you can purchase one here \->](/pricing).*

The above command will create an auth.json file in your project's root directory. This file contains your email and license key for downloading and installing Flux and should not be added to version control.

Because auth.json is not version controlled, you will need to manually recreate it in every new project environment. See below for [cloning an existing project](#cloning-an-existing-project) or how to [activate in CI](#activating-in-ci) or [activate using Laravel Forge](#activating-using-laravel-forge).

You can also view your [licenses and their associated install instructions here \->](/dashboard)

Now, add the @fluxAppearance and @fluxScripts Blade directives to your layout file:

```
<head>    ...    @fluxAppearance</head><body>    ...    @fluxScripts</body>
```

The last step is to set up Tailwind CSS. Flux uses Tailwind CSS for its default styling.

*Flux v2.0 requires Tailwind CSS v4.1 or later.*

If you already have Tailwind installed in your project, just add the following configuration to your resources/css/app.css file:

```
@import 'tailwindcss';@import '../../vendor/livewire/flux/dist/flux.css';@custom-variant dark (&:where(.dark, .dark *));
```

If you don't have Tailwind installed, you can learn how to install it on the [Tailwind website](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/guides/laravel).

Although completely optional, we recommend using the [Inter font family](https://rsms.me/inter) for your application.

Add the following to the head tag in your layout file to ensure the font is loaded:

```
<head>    ...    <link rel="preconnect" href="https://fonts.bunny.net">
<link href="https://fonts.bunny.net/css?family=inter:400,500,600&display=swap" rel="stylesheet" /></head>
```

You can configure Tailwind to use this font family in your resources/css/app.css file:

```
@import 'tailwindcss';@import '../../vendor/livewire/flux/dist/flux.css';...@theme {    --font-sans: Inter, sans-serif;}
```

## Theming

We've meticulously designed Flux to look great out of the box, however, every project has its own identity. You can choose from our hand-picked color schemes or build your own theme by customizing CSS variables.

[Learn more about theming Flux \->](/docs/theming)

## Disable dark mode

By default, Flux will handle the appearance of your application by adding a dark class to the html element depending on the user's system preference or selected appearance.

[Learn more about dark mode \->](/docs/dark-mode)

If you don't want Flux to handle this for you, you can remove the @fluxAppearance directive from your layout file.

```
<head>    ...--    @fluxAppearance</head>
```

Now you can handle the appearance of your application manually.

## Publishing components

To keep things simple, you can use the internal Flux components in your Blade files directly. However, if you'd like to customize a specific Flux component, you can publish its blade file(s) into your project using the following Artisan command:

```
php artisan flux:publish
```

You will be prompted to search and select which components you want to publish. If you want to publish all components at once, you can use the \--all flag.

[Learn more about customizing Flux \->](/docs/customization)

## Keeping Flux updated

To ensure you have the latest version of Flux, regularly update your composer dependencies:

```
composer update livewire/flux livewire/flux-pro
```

If you've published Flux components, make sure to check the changelog for any breaking changes before updating:

[Flux release notes (changelog) \->](https://github.com/livewire/flux/releases)

## Cloning an existing project

If you're cloning an existing project that uses Flux Pro, you will need to authenticate your Flux Pro installation.

When running composer install, you will be prompted to provide a username and password:

-   Enter your Flux account email as the username
-   Enter your Flux license key as the password

To avoid manually typing these credentials, you can create a Composer auth.json file.

To do this, run the following command before you run composer install:

```
composer config http-basic.composer.fluxui.dev your-email your-license-key
```

Make sure to replace \`your-email\` and \`your-license-key\` with your actual Flux account email and license key, which you can find on your [dashboard \->](/dashboard).

This will create an auth.json file in your project's root directory. This file contains your email and license key for downloading and installing Flux Pro and should not be added to version control.

You can now run composer install and it should automatically authenticate the Flux Pro installation.

## Activating using Laravel Forge

If you are using Laravel Forge, you can take advantage of their built in [Packages](https://forge.laravel.com/docs/sites/packages.html) feature for authenticating private composer packages.

Laravel Forge allows you to manage packages on a server or site level. If you have multiple sites using Flux, then it's recommended to manage Packages on the server level.

To authenticate Flux, head over to the packages page on either the server or site. You will then see the following:

![Laravel Forge Packages](/img/forge-activation.png)

Click the "Add Credential" button to authenticate with a new private composer package and enter the following details:

-   Enter composer.fluxui.dev as the Repository URL
-   Enter your Flux account email as the username
-   Enter your Flux license key as the password

Finally, click the "Save" button. You should now be authenticated with the Flux private composer server and be able install Flux using composer require livewire/flux-pro

For more information, please refer to the [Laravel Forge Packages documentation](https://forge.laravel.com/docs/sites/packages.html).

## Activating using Laravel Cloud

If you are using Laravel Cloud, you will need to use their [Build Commands](https://cloud.laravel.com/docs/environments#build-commands) feature for authenticating private composer packages.

To authenticate Flux, open up the environment you wish to use Flux in and go to "Settings" and then "Deployments".

![Laravel Cloud Environment Settings](/img/cloud-install.png)

There you will find a "Build Commands" section. Add the following command above the existing composer install command:

```
composer config http-basic.composer.fluxui.dev your-email your-license-key
```

Make sure to replace \`your-email\` and \`your-license-key\` with your actual Flux account email and license key, which you can find on your [dashboard \->](/dashboard).

Finally, click the "Save" button. You should now be authenticated with the Flux private composer server and be able deploy your application.

For more information, please refer to the [Laravel Cloud Private Composer Packages documentation](https://cloud.laravel.com/docs/environments#private-composer-packages).

## Activating in GitHub Actions

If you are using Flux in GitHub Actions, you will need to add Flux's license details to your repository's secrets and then configure your GitHub Actions workflows accordingly.

To add your Flux license details as secrets in your GitHub repository, first browse to your repository on GitHub and then go to **Settings > Secrets and variables > Actions**.

From here, click on "New repository secret":

![GitHub Actions Secrets](/img/github-actions-secrets.png)

You will need to add the following secrets:

-   FLUX\_USERNAME – Your Flux account email
-   FLUX\_LICENSE\_KEY – Your Flux license key

Once you've added these secrets, if you're using Laravel's [Livewire Starter Kit](https://laravel.com/docs/12.x/starter-kits#livewire), everything else should already be configured for you.

If you are not using the Livewire Starter Kit, you will need to add the following configuration to your GitHub Actions workflows:

```
- name: Add Flux license  run: composer config http-basic.composer.fluxui.dev "${{ secrets.FLUX_USERNAME }}" "${{ secrets.FLUX_LICENSE_KEY }}"
```

This should be placed before the step that runs composer install.

To see this in action, check out the GitHub Actions workflow included with the [Livewire starter kit \->](https://github.com/laravel/livewire-starter-kit/blob/4d2f09640b1829f542f3aa31b5180eaacc91febe/.github/workflows/tests.yml).

You can now run your GitHub Actions workflow again and it should successfully authenticate the Flux Pro installation.

## Activating in CI

If you are using Flux in a CI environment without an auth.json file, you can add the following environment variables and command to your CI script:

```
composer config http-basic.composer.fluxui.dev "${FLUX_USERNAME}" "${FLUX_LICENSE_KEY}"
```

## Configuring nginx

If you run into problems loading Flux's JavaScript and CSS assets, you may need to configure your nginx server to allow for this.

By default, Flux exposes two routes in your application to serve its assets from: /flux/flux.js and /flux/flux.css.

This is fine for most applications, however, if you are using nginx with a custom configuration, you may receive a 404 from this endpoint.

To fix this issue, you can add the following to your nginx configuration:

```
location ~ ^/flux/flux(\.min)?\.(js|css)$ {    expires off;    try_files $uri $uri/ /index.php?$query_string;}
```
